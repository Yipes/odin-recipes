<h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p><ul>
        <li>Nonstick cooking spray</li>
        <li>1 cup firmly packed light or dark brown sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup natural peanut butter</li>
        <li>1/2 cup carrot or cauliflower puree</li>
        <li>1/2 cup banana puree</li>
        <li>1 large egg white</li>
        <li>1 cup whole-wheat flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul></p>

<h3>Steps</h3>
    <p><ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350Ëš. Coat a 12-cup muffin tin with cooking spray or line with paper baking cups.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, mix 1/2 cup of the brown sugar with the peanut butter, the vegetable and banana purees,
            and the egg white, using a wooden spoon.</li>
        <li>Put the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a bowl or zipper-lock bag and stir or shake to mix.
            Add to the bowl with the peanut butter mixture and stir just to combine 
            (the batter will be a little lumpy-do not overmix). Add the remaining 1/2 cup of brown sugar and stir once or twice.</li>
        <li>Divide the batter among the muffin cups and bake until the muffins are lightly browned and a toothpick comes out clean 
            when inserted into the center, 15 to 20 minutes. Turn the muffins out onto a rack to cool.</li>
        <li>Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days, or wrap individually
            and freeze for up to 1 month.</li>
